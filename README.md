- 👋 Hi, I’m Charles Hoskins
For the past ten years I've worked in recruitment building teams of Electronic Design & Firmware Engineers. I've placed hundreds of people in that time (maybe you? Hi 👋🏼) but I'm always wanting to learn more about the world I operate in.
- 👀 I’m interested in ... Leanring about Firmware, what's recent? What's up to date? How can someone in my position better understand the problems you help solve
- 📫 How to reach me ... Charles@sr2rec.co.uk
